Debugging is the act of figuring out the difference between the expected and reality of the current code and then patching it. A program is called **stable** if it doesn't have a lot of obvious bugs. On the contrary, it is called **buggy** or **unstable** if the code has a large number of bugs that affect the functionality and cause incorrect results.

There are an infinite amount of ways a bugs can come to existence, but most commonly sprouted from:
- Communication issues in the team;
- Misunderstanding of the requirements;
- Software complexity;
- Programming errors;
- Use of unfamiliar technologies;
- An error in a third-party library.

## Avoiding Bugs
It's almost impossible to avoid all bugs in a large program, but it is possible to reduce their number. These are the five steps that can help you, as a developer, to help you avoid bugs:
1. Make sure you know what to do.
2. Decompose a program into smaller units.
3. Write easy-to-read code.
4. Run the program with boundary input values.
5. Write automated tests that will check the program at the build time.
