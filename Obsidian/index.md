## Motivation
*I've graduated school, and I miss learning.*

Lately I've been feeling like there's too many knowledge that I don't know about that can't be made with by creating personal projects. For example, learning more about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), refactoring tricks, or for a more *embedded* technology like learning about software layers.

Crazy I would tell myself when I was 14 years old, but I really do miss learning and training myself to contain more tech knowledge in general - I want to continue learning more to improve myself. Some people look up on me, but really, I'm just a person who only spent four years in school, dabbling in some fun and motivated projects here and there. I can't let them down. I can't let me down either. I've always wanted to be the person to be reached out for when they need some sort of help. The "first-aid kit" type of senior.

Anyways, I'm making this repository as sort of a motivation, but also a log of what I've learned in my career from hereon - a tracker of each and every one of my learnings. This repository is designed to contain pages of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes to contain all the cool things I came across after graduation. It'd be awesome if random strangers come by and look at my notes and go "wow this is pretty cool", just like how I read through random people's Medium pages for information and go "wow this is pretty cool".

I'm going to start from the very basics, then end up noting about the things I want to be better at, which is mostly going to relate to the kind of work I'm doing. Eventually, this repository is going to become something like a library, where it'll be a collection of notes for different kinds of subjects. The term *library* has a different meaning in software engineering though, so I'll just call it library in a different language. The Korean word for library doesn't sound cool (*do-seo-kwan*)... I think I'm going to call it *Biblioth√®que*, the French word for Library.

And just for fun, I'll also add in some hobbies outside of the technological world as well. Mostly to kee

I'll figure out how you, probably a random person of the internet, or likely my friends lol, can access my notes without downloading Obsidian. Until then, I'll be writing about things.
