Cold brew is a cold drink where the coffee grounds were steeped at cool temperatures for an extended period (12 - 24 hours).
## Origin
Cold brew coffee originated in Japan, where it has been a traditional method of coffee brewing for centuries. Slow-drip cold brew, also known as Kyoto-style, or as Dutch coffee in East Asia refers to a process in which water is dripped through coffee grounds at room temperature over of many hours.

Because the ground coffee beans in cold-brewed coffee never come into contact with heated water, the process of leaching the flavour from the beans produces a chemical profile different from conventional brewing methods. 
## Recipe
Just make iced coffee instead.
