Flat white is a simple drink consisting of [[Espresso|espresso]] and steamed milk.
## Origin
The origins of the flat white are contentious, with New Zealand, Australia, and England debating its invention. However, it has gained popularity in the early 1980s in Australia.

People often associate the drink to the "in-between" of a [[Caff√® Latte]] and a [[Cappuccino]], because:
- It is served with microfoams like the latte, but
- It requires less milk, like the cappuccino.

A good rule-of-thumb is a 1:2 ratio of coffee and milk.
## Recipe
Creating a flat white is simple:
1. Brew espresso;
2. Steam milk (usually for about 2-4 seconds of stretching) in a milk jug;
3. Stop steaming when it reaches about 65 degrees (when you feel uncomfortable holding the milk jug).
