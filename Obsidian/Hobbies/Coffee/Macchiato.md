Macchiato is an Italian drink consisting of equal parts or more of [[Espresso|espresso]] and steamed milk.
## Origin
Macchiato means "to be stained" in Italian, which stems from baristas showing waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it. Lmao.
## Recipe
Creating a macchiato is simple:
1. Brew espresso;
2. Steam milk (usually for about 4 seconds of stretching) in a milk jug;
3. Stop steaming when it reaches about 65 degrees (when you feel uncomfortable holding the milk jug).
