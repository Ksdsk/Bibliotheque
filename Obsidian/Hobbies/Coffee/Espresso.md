## Extracting espresso
You can extract espresso, or more in slang, *pull a shot of espresso* with an espresso machine specifically designed to create pressure through the tamped beans. As a barista, you can control the amount of pressure, size, and the duration of the pulling to control the taste profile of the espresso.

The size of the espresso 
### Normale
A normale is the common shot of espresso which aims to extract about the double the weight of the coffee grounds.

It has a ratio of 1:2 (1 part coffee beans to 2 part water).
### Ristretto
A ristretto is a common *short shot* of espresso which is brewed with the same amount of coffee grounds, but extracted using only half as much water. The taste of this espresso tends to be more concentrated, unbalanced, and obviously more little than a typical shot of espresso.
### Lungo
A lungo is a common *long shot* of espresso, opposite of [[#Ristretto]], the extraction requires double the amount of water.
