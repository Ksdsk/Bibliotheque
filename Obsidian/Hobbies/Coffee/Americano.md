Americano is a drink consisting of [[espresso]] and hot water.
## Origin
Caffe Americano, or simply *Americano*, means "American Coffee" in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The coffee was thought to be originated by the American G.I.s where they decided to dilute espresso with hot water to approximate to their own taste.
## Recipe
Creating an Americano is simple:
1. Prepare water about 4 times the amount of espresso at 90 degrees;
2. Brew espresso;
3. Pour the hot water over the espresso.
## Long Black
A long black is essentially the same as an americano, but instead of pouring water over the espresso, you will pour the espresso over the hot water. This keeps the espresso's crema intact.
