Cappuccino is an [[Espresso|espresso]]-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steaming milk including a layer of milk foam. It is typically smaller in volume than a [[Caff√® Latte]], and topped with a thick layer of foam rather than being made with microfoam.
## Origin
The name comes from the Capuchin Friars, referring to the color of their habits, which in this context, refers to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee. 

The Viennese bestowed the name *Kapuziner*, which was introduced to northern Italy during the period of Austrian domination, which it when it took the Italian name of Cappuccino.
## Recipe
Creating a cappuccino is similar to a latte:
1. Brew espresso;
2. Steam milk (usually for about 8-10 seconds to create a layer of foam);
3. Stop steaming when it reaches about 65 degrees (when you feel uncomfortable holding the milk jug).
