Caffè latte is a Spanish drink consisting of equal parts of [[Espresso|espresso]] and steamed milk.
## Origin
The term *cortado* is itself broadly associated with various coffee or espresso beverages having been "cut" with milk. It is very similar or the same as the Italian [[Macchiato]] or the [[Flat White]], 
## Recipe
Creating a caffè latte is simple:
1. Brew espresso;
2. Steam milk (usually for about 4 seconds of stretching) in a milk jug;
3. Stop steaming when it reaches about 65 degrees (when you feel uncomfortable holding the milk jug).
## Iced Latte
Iced latte is a chilled form of a caffè latte. It is one of the most popular form of iced coffee beverage.

The recipe is not much different from a latte:
1. Brew espresso;
2. Mix in two teaspoons of sugar or honey (sweetness differs!);
3. Mix in an ice fragment to cool the espresso;
4. Steam milk (stretch for about 4 seconds);
5. Take out a chilled glass with ice filled to the brim;
6. Pour the espresso into the chilled glass and mix until the temperature is even;
7. Pour the steamed milk into the chilled glass;
8. Mix until fully blended.
