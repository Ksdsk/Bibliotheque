Caffè mocha is an [[Espresso|espresso]]-based, chocolate-flavoured warm beverage and a variation of [[Caffè Latte]], but usually served in a glass rather than a mug. A common alias is *mocha*, *mochaccino*, or *mochachino*.
## Origin
The name *mocha* comes from the Yemeni port of *Mokha*, which was a port well-known for its coffee trade from the 15th to 17th century. When the coffee culture expanded to Europe, the people referred to the coffee imports from Arabia as *Mocha*.

The coffee we drink today is made by adding chocolate, and that may have been because of the chocolate flavour that could be found in Yemeni coffee beans.
## Recipe
Creating a caffè mocha is simple:
1. Brew espresso
2. Make hot chocolate
3. Mix the two together.

Mochaccino is a variation of caffè mocha, with a more latte-like recipe:
1. Brew espresso
2. Steam milk (about 4 seconds of stretching)
3. Drizzle some chocolate syrup and mix it with the espresso
4. Add the steamed milk in
5. Decorate with cocoa powder or more chocolate syrup.
