> A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. [Network Protocol Definition | Computer Protocol | Computer Networks | CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-network-protocol)
## How Network Protocols Work
Network protocols take large-scale processes and break them down into small, specific tasks or functions. This occurs at every level of the network, and each function must cooperate at each level to complete the larger task at hand. The term **protocol suite** refers to a set of smaller network protocols working in conjunction with each other.

Network protocols are typically created according to industry standard by various networking or information technology organizations. The following groups have defined and published different network protocols:
- [[The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]]
- [[The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)]]
- [[The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]
- [[The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)]]
- [[The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]]
