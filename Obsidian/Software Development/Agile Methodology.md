The Agile Methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking into smaller phases to emphasize continuous collaboration and incremental improvements.
# Framework
Agile, as popular it is, comes in with different forms that are targeted for certain task cases. The two very popular framework are the [[Scrum]] and [[Kanban]] workflow. The main differences between the two can be best-described with a table:

|           | Scrum                                                                                                            | Kanban                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Origin    | Software Development                                                                                             | Lean manufacturing                                                                           |
| Idealogy  | Learn through experiences, self-organize and prioritize, and reflect on wins and losses to continuously improve. | Use visuals to improve work-in-progress.                                                     |
| Cadence   | Regular, fixed length sprints (usually two weeks).                                                               | Continuous flow.                                                                             |
| Practices | Sprint planning, sprint, daily scrum, spring review, sprint retrospectives.                                      | Visualize the flow of work, limit work-in-progress, manage flow, incorporate feedback loops. |
| Roles     | Product owner, scrum master, development team.                                                                   | No required roles.                                                                           |

# Why it's so popular
Many teams are attracted to Agile for its flexibility and responsiveness to changes. It's often easier to think about a smaller design goal than a large one, and especially so in bigger projects. It also involves a lot of human-to-human process to discuss about goals and be adjusted to their needs as time flows.
