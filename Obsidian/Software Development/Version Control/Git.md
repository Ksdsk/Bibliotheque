This entire note will be very inspired by [Atlassian's Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and also [Practical Guide to Git from JetBrains Academy (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eBieLWZQOM). 

Git is a version control system, which is the tool of tracking and managing changes to the software code.
