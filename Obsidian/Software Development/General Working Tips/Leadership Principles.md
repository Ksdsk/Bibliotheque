## Customer Obsession
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

We always try to help customers make the best possible decision. Earning their trust is a key to victory. Having this honest communication between us and the customers, we can maximize both of our worlds - customers are happy, we're happy that we could help.

As a large example, AWS always looks to cost-optimize for customers where they can save money, which we can redeploy that money in the future.

As a leader, we should always ask the questions that aim to benefit the customers, such as:
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- **What will customers care most about?**
- What would they be most disappointed about?
- What will they love most?

Sometimes, competitors could leave us confused. If a competitor builds something  that customers love, we should be aware of it, and we should be inspired by it and think about how we can improve our own customer experience with what we learn from what competitors have done.
## Ownership
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

Great owners are always asking themselves, what would I do if this were my personal money?
