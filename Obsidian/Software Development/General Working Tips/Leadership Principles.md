## Customer Obsession
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

We always try to help customers make the best possible decision. Earning their trust is a key to victory. Having this honest communication between us and the customers, we can maximize both of our worlds - customers are happy, we're happy that we could help.

As a large example, AWS always looks to cost-optimize for customers where they can save money, which we can redeploy that money in the future. So looking out for the customers can be very cyclic.

As a leader, we should always ask the questions that aim to benefit the customers, such as:
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- **What will customers care most about?**
- What would they be most disappointed about?
- What will they love most?

Sometimes, competitors could leave us confused. If a competitor builds something  that customers love, we should be aware of it, and we should be inspired by it and think about how we can improve our own customer experience with what we learn from what competitors have done.
## Ownership
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

Great owners are always asking themselves, what would I do if this were my personal money? Don't think about the short-term benefits like nailing a very temporary object into a wall, but think like an owner and try to maintain the upkeep of your products.

The ideal leaders at Amazon are the ones who:
- Feel like owners;
- Think about problems holistically; and
- Finds the right owner to resolve issue if necessary.

Owners ensure the problems are owned, that they have a path to resolution and they drive it themselves as needed.

When there's a hard problem, owners don't delegate it to the next person in line. Try to pull a group of people together to find the right solution for the customers. 
## Invent and Simplify
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Although difficult, we constantly look to invent, and also re-invent our ideas. Our inventions are not just random ones though - we always think about what the customers want the very most. Then, we struggle to make it happen for the customers.
## Are Right, A Lot
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

You can do a lot of things right, but if you make a wrong decision, you might have an issue. We work to keep this miss-rate very low.
