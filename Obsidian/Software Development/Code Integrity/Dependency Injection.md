> Dependency injection is a programming technique in which an object or function received other objects or function that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally. [Dependency injection - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)

Dependency Injection is a [[Design Pattern|design pattern]] to promote the *separation of concerns*, while ensuring that an object or function that wants to use a given service should not have to know how to construct those services. Instead, the receiving *client*, the object or function, is provided ith its dependencies by external code.

This is a key partner to the [[Object-Oriented Design|object-oriented design]], the *Dependency Inversion Principle*.
