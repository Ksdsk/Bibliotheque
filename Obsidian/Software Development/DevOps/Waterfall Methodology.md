Waterfall Methodology is a common project management workflow which has the characteristics of a waterfall, hence the nickname.

> Like a waterfall, each process phase cascades downward sequentially through the SDLC stages. [Waterfall Methodology for Project Management | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/waterfall-methodology)

Unlike other methods like [[Agile Methodology]], Waterfall does not allow the engineers to begin the next phase without fully completing the current phase - your team cannot move forward until they resolve the problems. This can lead to big technical debt later in maintenance.
