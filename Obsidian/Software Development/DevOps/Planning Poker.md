> Also called *Scrum Poker*, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in [[Agile Methodology|agile principles]]. [Planning poker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)

The reason to use planning poker is to avoid the influence of the other participants. If a number is spoken, it can sound like a suggestion and influence the other participants' sizing. Planning poker should force people to *think independently* and propose their numbers *simultaneously*. 

Planning poker generally takes during the [[Scrum#Sprint Planning|sprint planning]] stage of Scrum.
## Equipment
Planning poker is based on a list of features to be delivered, several copies of a deck of cards, and optionally, an egg timer that can be used to limit time spent in discussion of each item. 

The cards given to each player usually follows the **Fibonacci Sequence**. The reason for using the Fibonacci sequence instead of simply doubling each subsequent value is because estimating a task as exactly double the effort of another task is misleadingly precise. Some popular variations of the planning poker deck deviate slightly from the Fibonacci sequence. For example: 0, $\frac{1}{2}$, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, and optionally, a `?` (unsure).

In many cases, these equipment are digitized into applications to speed up the process.
## Procedure
At the sprint planning meeting, each estimator is given one deck of the cards. All decks have identical set of cards in them.

The meeting proceeds as follows:
- A Moderator, who will not play, chairs the meeting.
- The [[Scrum#Roles|Product Owner]] provides a short overview of one [[User Stories|user story]] to be estimated. The team is given an opportunity to ask questions and discuss to clarify assumptions and risks. A summary of the discussion can be recorded by the Moderator.
- Each individual lays a card face down representing their estimate for the story. Units used can vary - they can be days or st
