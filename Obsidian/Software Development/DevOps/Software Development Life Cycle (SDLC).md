## What is it?
Software development life cycle, or *SDLC*, is "the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software" [What is SDLC? - Software Development Lifecycle Explained - AWS (amazon.com)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sdlc/#:~:text=The%20software%20development%20lifecycle%20(SDLC,expectations%20during%20production%20and%20beyond.). In short, it's a methodology that steps-out the phases of development to maximize transparency of work, thus enabling efficient estimation of tasks and systematic delivery of software.
## The Phases
There are six phases of an usual software development cycle:
- Plan
- Design
- Implement
- Test
- Deploy
- Maintain
### Plan
The planning phase includes task related to analysis. For example, cost-benefit analysis, resource analysis, allocation, and so on. Your role, as a software developer, is to collect the requirements from your clients, discuss about those requirements, and finding the best method to implement that idea. Usually, these data will be stored inside of a specification document. 

The end goal of this phase is to create a common goal between you, your team, and your customers.
### Design
The design phase includes tasks related to identification of solutions. This is done through analyzing the requirements set in the planning phase to create a feasible idea to iterate on. The tasks can include comparing technology choices, identifying development tools, checking if a premade module is available, and so on. 

The end goal of this phase is to figure out how to best integrate available software, or create new ones if necessary, to reach the goal.
### Implement
The implementation phase includes tasks related to engineering and coding the product. This is done through the analysis of the requirements set in the design phase.

The end goal of this phase is to iterate upon the design and creating a model to test the functionalities.
### Test
The testing phase includes creating automations to continuously test the implemented features. Usually this is done in parallel with the implementation phase, but sometimes, this can be done before the implementation phase, and the [[Test-Driven Design]] methodology actually encourages such design.

The end goal of this phase is to create a continuous feed of quality analysis to check if the implemented design is deliverable to the customers at a satisfactory level.
### Deploy
The deploy phase includes the tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment. 
### Maintain
The maintaining phase includes the tasks to address issues voiced by the customers, refactor the code for the betterment of maintaining, and identifying new ways to improve the software.
## List of Methodologies for SDLC
Here are some of the popular methodologies that upholds the nature of SDLC:
- [[Waterfall Methodology]]
	- Arranges all the phases sequentially so that each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase.
	- Can be slow.
	- Not as flexible.
- [[Agile Methodology]]
	- Arranges the phases into several development cycles of little size (*sprints*), making small but incremental software changes in each cycle.
	- Engage customers and stakeholders to obtain feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
	- Very flexible.
	- Speed depends on the customer feedback, but on average faster than Waterfall for big projects.
