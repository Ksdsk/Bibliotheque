> Single Sign-On is a type of authentication in which a user logs in to one system and is automatically granted access to other services.. Rather than having an employee create a separate set of credentials for each app, they simply login once and can access any app the IT administrator has given them access to.

You've likely experienced SSO before. For example, when you sign up for Gmail, you are automatically authenticated to YouTube, AdSense, Analytics, and more. Likewise, if you log out of your Gmail or other Google apps, you are automatically logged out of all the apps.
## History
The rise of the web changed the way software was consumed. [[Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)]] has become the standard by which modern applications and services are accessed. This model allowed for many start-ups to build specialized products that focused on a singular task and do it well. Protecting each individual software would be extremely hard and tiring for many. This is when the idea of SSO arose.
