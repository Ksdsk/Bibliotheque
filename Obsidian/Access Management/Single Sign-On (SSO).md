> Single Sign-On is a type of authentication in which a user logs in to one system and is automatically granted access to other services.. Rather than having an employee create a separate set of credentials for each app, they simply login once and can access any app the IT administrator has given them access to.

You've likely experienced SSO before. For example, when you sign up for Gmail, you are automatically authenticated to YouTube, AdSense, Analytics, and more. Likewise, if you log out of your Gmail or other Google apps, you are automatically logged out of all the apps.
## How it works
With an example for a typical SSO:
![[Pasted image 20240818230045.png]]
The **authorization server** lives on `domain3`. `domain1` and `domain2` interface with `domain3` to both [[Authentication|authenticate]] a user and also to verify that the user is authenticated. In this implementation, the user will still log in with one of the above-mentioned authentication types. However, they will only have to provide this set of credentials once. The SSO system will take care of granting authentications.

## SSO and AuthX
### Authentication
A good [[Authentication|authentication]] experience can seem at odds with properly implemented security. Many organizations require a strong password, and some even ask the users to change their password every interval. 

Keeping up with these requirements for one application is inconvenient enough, but doing so for five or ten applications leads users to adopt some pretty bad practices like reusing the same password for each app, writing down their passwords on a sticky note and taping on their monitor, and so on.

Authentication experience is simplified for the user, while the organization benefits from better security.
### Authorization
Ensuring the right level of access is very important and is difficult to do in a non-SSO implementation. Different applications present different levels of granularity when it comes to user permission which makes [[Authorization|authorization]] even more difficult. SSO aims to solve this authorization component of identity by providing a centralized source of truth for each individual user. Once a user is authenticated, the IdP can send each application the users' identity permissions for each application. IT admins now have a single location where they can manage user roles and permissions for the entire organization. This makes it easier to audit and ensure the right users have the right access at all times.

Authorization experience is handled from a centralized location and can be easily managed.
## Federation
SSO provides a solution for all components related with authentication and authorization. Through [[Identity Federation]], an IT administrator can provision and deprovision user accounts once, grant them varying levels of access for each app, and enforce security requirements all from a single source of truth.
## Identity Protocols and Providers
Let's highlight some of the common protocols used in SSO, their benefits and downsides, and examples where these protocols are used in:
- [[Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)]]
- [[OAuth]]
- [[OpenID Connect (OIDC)]]
## Customer Perspective for Implementing SSO
### Advantage
The big reasons to buy an identity management platform is that you can get your solution up-and-running in no time. Saving time versus building, testing, quality-assuring, and deploying a home-grown solution can mean be very slow. 
### Disadvantage
The disadvantage to buy an identity management platform for SSO is that you use some control. The customer's identity data is stored in a third-party server. It also means you are adding another dependency to the technology stack. It may not also be customizable to your needs.
